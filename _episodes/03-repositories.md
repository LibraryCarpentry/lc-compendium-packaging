## What is a “Trustworthy” Repository?

As you have learned so far in this curriculum, the data curation process entails many steps that support the long-term sustainability and reuse of your research data. In this episode, you will learn why storing this compendium package in an appropriate location is a crucial step in ensuring that other researchers can find your data and research outputs and reuse them in the future. With a steadily increasing amount of data repositories available to researchers, it can be difficult to know which repository is right for your research data and will support keeping your data safeguarded and preserved. Lin et al. (2020) define a set of principles defining digital repositories that serve this function called the TRUST principles:  

**T** - Transparency

**R** - Responsibility 

**U** - User Focus

**S** - Sustainability 

**T** - Technology 

If a digital repository enacts these principles, you can reasonably consider it to be a trustworthy repository for your data. A helpful guiding framework for assessing if a digital repository exemplifies the TRUST principles is the [CoreTrustSeal certification](https://www.coretrustseal.org/), which offers a [catalogue of requirements](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3638211) that represent a trustworthy data repository for your research data. This catalogue includes 16 data repository requirements that are assessed in repositories and if the repository meets those requirements, it gains the CoreTrustSeal certification. In the “Things to Consider When Choosing a Repository” section below, the process of assessing the trustworthiness of a repository based on the CoreTrustSeal requirements are detailed.

> ## Spotlight: Data Sharing Platforms - Are They Trustworthy Repositories?
>
> There are many platforms available to researchers for storing and sharing their data, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Open Science Framework](https://www.cos.io/products/osf), and [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html). However, can these platforms be considered trustworthy repositories? Information scientists and librarians often do not place these kinds of data sharing platforms in the same categories as other trustworthy repositories, despite their heavy usage as research compendium storage products. Data curators may need to discuss with researchers why a trustworthy repository is a better choice for the long-term preservation of their research compendium, based on the following reasons: 
>
> 1. While these platforms may have high visibility in some research areas (such as geospatial scientists sharing data in ArcGIS Online), they often do not adhere to the CoreTrustSeal requirements and the TRUST principles. This means that the data may not have the same assurances for long-term preservation, governance, and transparency as a trustworthy repository.
>
> 2. Trustworthy repositories have dedicated personnel to support data depositors, which may not be the case with these kinds of data sharing platforms. Therefore, researchers may find themselves having to navigate data deposit issues without the advice and guidance of a data curator. 
>
> While platforms such as GitHub, Open Science Framework, and ArcGIS Online are useful project management and collaboration platforms for the research process, researchers should strive to store their research compendia in trusted repositories that fit the TRUST principles and CoreTrustSeal requirements.

## Finding a Repository

Now, you will learn more about the different types of repositories available to researchers, and how to assess their trustworthiness. As funding agencies and publishing outlets continue to push for more data sharing in academic research, the amount of repositories available for this data has also grown. Choosing a trustworthy repository is important for safeguarding the long-term sustainability and reuse potential of the data. Beyond the trustworthiness of a repository, there are categories of repositories that may be more suitable for the particular type of research data you are working with, and may support more exposure and reuse of your shared data. The Digital Curation Centre offers further resources and discussion on the benefits and considerations of each of these kinds of repositories. 

### Disciplinary and Subject-Focused Repositories

Disciplinary and subject-focused repositories cater to data and research outputs from specific areas of study and focus, such as political science, mechanical engineering, Indigenous data, and social sciences. Examples of disciplinary repositories include: 

1. [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), which provides access to research outputs concerning biomedical and genomic information
2. [Database of Religious History](https://religiondatabase.org/landing/), a repository containing quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to religious cultural history 
3. [Center for International Earth Science Information Network](https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data.html), which provides access to data concerning human-environment interactions across the world.  
4. [Mukurtu](https://mukurtu.org/), a platform which empowers Indigenous communities to manage, narrate, and share their digital heritage 
5. [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/), which maintains and provides access to an extensive archive of social science data for research and instruction purposes

Many disciplinary repositories can be found on [Re3data](http://www.re3data.org/), a registry of research data repositories that allows users to search by the research data subject (note that if a repository is included on re3data.org, it does not mean it is automatically a trusted repository and must still be evaluated for trustworthiness by the researchers). 

### Generalist Repositories 

Generalist repositories store and provide access to a wide range of research data types and do not restrict content types by discipline. These repositories are particularly useful for researchers whose discipline does not have a repository dedicated to their area of study. Examples of curated generalist repositories include: 

1. [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/)
2. [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash)
3. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

While many generalist repositories can be considered trustworthy repositories, researchers should still plan to evaluate each potential repository they are considering for their data. 

### Institutional Repositories

These repositories are associated with a particular institution, such as a university/college, research institute, or national laboratory., and are generally used to store and showcase the outputs of researchers within that institution (Callicott et al. 2016). These types of repositories generally accept research materials from all disciplines of research present at an institution, and thus can be considered generalist repositories as opposed to disciplinary repositories focusing on a specific area of research. Some schools have a single repository for all research products (such as Temple University’s TUScholarShare) while others may have separate repositories for data and other scholarly products (pre-prints, articles, Electronic Theses and Dissertations, etc.). Examples of institutional repositories include: 

1. [KiltHub](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/), the official institutional repository for Carnegie Mellon University, managed through the University Libraries
2. [Oxford University Research Archive](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/), the institutional repository for researchers at the University of Oxford
3. [Stanford Digital Repository](https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-digital-repository), managing scholarly outputs from researchers at Stanford University

Most institutional repositories have a dedicated support staff and a mission for preserving scholarly information, and often constitute a trustworthy digital repository. However, as is the case with disciplinary and generalist repositories, researchers should plan time in their research workflow to evaluate their repository of choice for trustworthiness.

## Things to Consider When Choosing a Repository

Now that you have learned about different categories of repositories, what are some additional tips for choosing the right repository for your data? Researchers can look for the CoreTrustSeal logo when visiting the website of a potential repository they might use for storing and sharing their compendium package.

However, your repository of interest may not have the official CoreTrustSeal certification. This does not necessarily mean that the repository cannot be considered trustworthy! You can still use the 16 requirements of the CoreTrustSeal certification to review your potential repository for trustworthiness and adherence to the TRUST principles. The CoreTrustSeal certification is an example of a standard used to signal that a repository meets the requirements of the TRUST principles, but due to the extensive certification process required, some repositories may not (yet) have this certification. Therefore, reviewing a repository that does not have the CoreTrustSeal certification for its adherence to the TRUST principles is incredibly important. 

> ## Spotlight: Repository Checklist

It is important to acknowledge that not every repository is a good fit for all data. Sometimes recommending a repository outside of your own institution is a better service than accepting something that is not a good fit. Take some time to explore a specific data set and repositories that would be a good fit for it. This hypothetical exercise will help get you out from under your repository biases.

> ## Exercise: Locate a Trustworthy Repository for a Dataset
> 
> Dataset: [Investing in Education in Europe: Attitudes, Politics and Policies (INVEDUC)](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13140)
>
> Now, let’s test out your knowledge so far from this episode by locating a trustworthy repository for the above dataset. Imagine you are the creator of this dataset, and you are looking for a repository to store this data to preserve and share it with others. Evaluate the characteristics (discipline, data type, etc.) of this dataset and use re3data.org [https://www.re3data.org/](https://www.re3data.org/) to identify three possible trustworthy repositories that are well-suited for the dataset. 
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > In a group discussion, demonstrate how your three possible repositories demonstrate trustworthiness and fit for this sample dataset. How would you decide which repository to choose?
> >
> > If you are having trouble finding appropriate repositories, consider these potential candidate repositories:
> >
> > - [European Data Portal](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100012199)
> > - [AidData](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010841) 
> > - [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100013193)
