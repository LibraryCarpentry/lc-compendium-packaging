<p>When preparing research materials to submit to a trustworthy
repository for long-term preservation and sharing, it is important to
package the materials in a way that enables other researchers to easily
understand the contents of each artifact contained in the compendium and
their function in relationship to one another. This can be accomplished
with logical file organization, standard file naming schemes, and file
version control.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The TIER (Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research) Protocol offers a
framework that specifies which files should be included in a research
compendium, what those files should contain, and how those files should
be organized in a hierarchical file folder structure. The TIER Protocol
was designed to support four specific standards for computational
reproducibility:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Sufficiency.</strong> The research compendium should
contain all materials necessary to computationally reproduce reported
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soup-to-nuts.</strong> The research compendium should
contain all materials necessary to re-trace the computational workflow
from beginning (preparing data for analysis) to end</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Portability.</strong> The research compendium should
continental all materials necessary to allow for computational
reproduction on any computer workstation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>(Almost) one-click reproducibility.</strong> The research
compendium should contain all materials necessary to generate results
using a single master script.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed in previous lessons in the Curating for Reproducibility
Curriculum, the research compendium, at a minimum, should contain a
readme, dataset, codebook, and script file. The file folder granularity
of TIER Protocol 4.0 goes further to reflect the reality of typical
computational research that often requires several data and script files
to perform all of the steps in the analytical workflow, some of which
may generate intermediate files that then become part of the analysis to
produce outputs.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/01-tier.jpg" title="TIER Protocol 4.0 directory structure" alt="TIER Protocol 4.0 directory structure" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Within the root <strong><code>Project/</code></strong> folder are the
<strong>README file</strong> (see Episode 3: Documentation Review] in <a href="https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-02-workflows/" class="external-link">Lesson
2: Curating for Reproducibilty Workflows</a> of the CuRe Curriculum),
the <strong>Report file</strong> (final article/report), and three
primary subfolders each containing specific files as described
below.</p>
<p><strong><code>Data/</code></strong></p>
<p>This folder should contain <strong>input data files</strong>
containing the data obtained from a primary source or constructed from
data collection/generation efforts, <strong>analysis data files</strong>
containing the processed data used in the analysis, and any
<strong>intermediate data files</strong> created during data processing
and stored temporarily to be used in subsequent steps of the
analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, for each input data file, there should be included a
<strong>codebook</strong> that defines the variables in the dataset and
a <strong>data sources guide</strong> that provides a data citation,
data availability/licensing information, and instructions on how to
access the data from their original sources.</p>
<p>For each analysis data file, the TIER Protocol also requires a
<strong>data appendix</strong>. Similar to a codebook, the data appendix
defines each variable. However, the data appendix also provides
information on the unit of observation, basic summary statistics, and
variable distributions.</p>
<p><strong><code>Scripts/</code></strong></p>
<p>This folder should include <strong>processing scripts</strong> used
to transform input data into analysis data files, analysis scripts used
to generate results presented in the final report/article, and
<strong>data appendix scripts</strong> used to produce results presented
in the appendix of the final report/article.</p>
<p>To help achieve (almost) one-click reproducibility, the TIER Protocol
also recommends a master script file, or <strong>main script
file</strong>, (see <a href="https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-03-assessing/" class="external-link">Episode
3: Code Inspection</a> in Lesson 3: Reproducibility Assessment of the
CuRe Curriculum) that runs all of the scripts in the proper order with
as little human intervention as possible beyond executing the main
script to produce the results presented in the report/article and the
appendix.</p>
<p><strong><code>Output/</code></strong></p>
<p>This folder should contain <strong>results files</strong> that
include the figures, tables, and any other results presented in the
final report/article as well as <strong>data appendix output
files</strong> that include the figures tables and any other outputs
presented in the appendix of the final report/article.</p>

<p>It is the rare researcher who routinely keeps their compendium files
in a neat folder structure like the one suggested by the TIER Protocol.
More often, files are delivered in a single folder with little
information on what each file contains. The next challenge will give you
a chance to transform a collection of files into an organized research
compendium.</p>

<p>As this episode explained, organizing files in a logical manner
supports reproducibility by making it more evident the purpose of each
file and the relationships among them. This is useful during curation
for reproducibility workflows that require understanding of the
analytical workflow in order to re-execute the analysis to confirm
reproducibility of results.</p>
<p>The file list below was extracted from the original README.txt
included in a research compendium submitted for curation. Organize the

<hr class="half-width">
<p>A good filename gives anyone who encounters the file an immediate
sense of what it contains and its function among other related files. By
establishing and consistently applying a standard file naming
convention, researchers, collaborators, and future users of the research
compendium can more easily locate, understand, and use the compendium
files.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="filename-elements">Filename elements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#filename-elements"></a>
</h3>
<p>An effective file naming convention prescribes standardized filenames
composed of descriptive elements that uniquely and concisely identify
each file. A convention might require some of the following
elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>short study title or study acronym</li>
<li>study location</li>
<li>sample</li>
<li>content type</li>
<li>file production/update date</li>
<li>researcher initials</li>
<li>file version number</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="filename-formatting">Filename formatting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#filename-formatting"></a>
</h3>
<p>File naming conventions should also take into account the computing
environment in which the files will be rendered and used. Some operating
systems and software applications impose character limits for object
names or treat characters in peculiar ways during certain operations. To
avoid problems as a result of this, file naming conventions should also
establish formatting standards for filenames and specific elements
within filenames such as those below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep filenames as short as possible.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of spaces and special characters.</li>
<li>Use underscores or camel case to enhance human readability.</li>
<li>Apply the ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD) format for dates.</li>
<li>Include leading zeros for sequential file numbering.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example below shows the application of a file naming convention
to files contained in a research compendium.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>During the course of the research lifecycle, data are being
manipulated, scripts are being updated, and documentation is being
revised. Recurrent changes made to files in the research compendium
reflect the iterative nature of research, which results in the
accumulation of several versions of a given file. Version control not
only keeps track of each version to make it easy to identify the precise
active files that should be used to perform a task, but also it makes it
possible to revert to prior versions of a file should issues with the
active file make it necessary. With regard to computational
reproducibility, being able to identify the precise files to be used to
execute the computational workflow to generate reported results is
critical.</p>
<p>Version control can be as simple as appending standardized file
version information to the file name, with the final version limited to
read-only access.</p>
<p><code>NCVitals_Birth_AnalysisData_20210213_v01.dta</code></p>
<p><code>NCVitals_Birth_AnalysisData_20210216_v02.dta</code></p>
<p><code>NCVitals_Birth_AnalysisData_20210522_v03.dta</code></p>
<p><code>NCVitals_Birth_AnalysisData_20210629_v04FINAL.dta</code></p>
<p>For research processes that require frequent file updates, the use of
a <strong>file storage and management system</strong> that automates the
assignment of version numbers to files as they are created and updated
(e.g., Box, Open Science Framework) can reduce the effort of tracking
versions of files.</p>
<p>The often non-linear nature of computational research can make
version control of script files a difficult task. <strong>Version
control systems</strong> like Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket are becoming
more popular among researchers as a tool for tracking changes to script
files as they write and revise their code. These tools have automated
processes for storing iterations of files while also capturing
information about each iteration (when it was created, who created it,
what changes were made to it). Git is especially useful for
collaborative projects because it also helps to synchronize programming
activities among collaborators, who otherwise would require careful
coordination to ensure the correct files are being used.</p>
<p>It is important to put into practice what one learns as they learn it
to not only retain but begin making it a habit. Let’s try it here by
practicing file naming.</p>

<p>Ideally, researchers would make their research compendium maximally
available by placing the materials into the public domain to allow for
unrestricted access and reuse. However, there are various justifiable
reasons why this may not be the best option based on applicable laws or
professional motives. Datasets that contain sensitive information about
human subjects or that are bound by licensing restrictions due to their
proprietary nature cannot be shared publicly. A researcher may want to
receive formal credit or attribution for creating the materials from
others who use them.</p>
<p>Whether a researcher decides to place the research compendium in the

of the research compendium, it is important to articulate for what
purpose the materials may be used along with any obligations that come

<p>For researchers who have full ownership of their materials and the
materials do not present privacy concerns, licenses can be a useful tool
for sharing materials without requiring others to request formal
permission to use the materials.</p>
<p>A license is a formal document that defines acceptable uses of a work
by granting permission and setting conditions. Whereas copyright (as it
is defined and enforced by U.S. copyright law) can act as a legal
roadblock to reproducibility by conferring exclusive use rights to the
creator of research materials, licenses remove this roadblock while
still providing the creator a legal framework for enforcing specified
acceptable uses and/or conditions for use of the materials.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Spotlight: Licensing “Facts”?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>When it comes to applying licenses to research data, questions have
been raised about whether or not United States Copyright law allows it.
According to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-37/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-202/section-202.1" class="external-link">37
CFR Part 202.1</a>, certain materials are not subject to copyright,
including “works consisting entirely of information that is common
property containing no original authorship, such as, for example:
Standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers,
schedules of sporting events, and lists or tables taken from public
documents or other common sources.” In other words, facts–which often
are how data are described–are not copyrightable. For copyright law to
apply, a work must be an authored work that is both original and
sufficiently creative.</p>
<p>It has been successfully argued that research data can be shown to
meet this standard of copyrightable works when originality and
creativity is expressed in terms of the author’s selection and
arrangement of the data within a database (see <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/" class="external-link">Feist
Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340
(1991)</a>). Therefore, while the facts themselves are not subject to
copyright, licenses can be applied to structured databases–i.e.,
datasets–that contain facts.</p>

<p>Creative Commons licenses have become widely recognized for its ease
of use and understandability. Creative Commons was founded in 2001 as a
non-profit organization helping creators make their works publicly
available for use under certain conditions and without the encumbrances
of copyright.</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses offer many advantages because they allow
creators to select from a range of licenses with different degrees of
permissiveness, they offer standardized machine-readable legal text
along with easy-to-understand summaries, and they are enforceable
worldwide. Below are the license options offered by Creative Commons
(version 4.0 International).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/02-cc-terms.png" title="Create Commons licenses" alt="Creative Commons licenses" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>For researchers who may want to place their materials into the public

offers the CC0 public dedication tool.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/02-cc0.jpg" title="CC0 Public Dedication Tool" alt="CC0 Public Dedication Tool" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>By applying CC0 to their materials, the researcher grants permission

purpose and without conditions.</p>
<p>Besides Creative Commons, there are numerous licensing options for
researchers to choose from, each allowing declaration of certain use
conditions that may not or may not be relevant to a particular type of
material. The table below presents a list of other widely used licenses,
the permissions and conditions the licenses define, and the types of

<h3 class="callout-title">Discussion: Principles of Scientific Licensing: The Reproducible Research Standard</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Considering the effect licensing can have on establishing scientific
norms for sharing research outputs, Victoria Stodden (2009) proposed the
Reproducible Research Standard (RRS) as a structure for ensuring that
scientific works are made publicly available under licensing terms that
promote openness required for reproducible research:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/02-rrs.jpg" title="The Reproducible Research Standard" alt="The Reproducible Research Standard" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The RRS proposes that the research compendium be made available to
the public under licensing terms that give others permission to copy and
use the compendium. Doing so follows the Principle of Scientific
Licensing, which states that “Legal encumbrances to the dissemination,
sharing, use, and re-use of scientific compendia should be minimized,
and require strong and compelling rationale before application”
(p. 28).</p>
<p>Thinking about the RRS and the Principle of Scientific Licensing,
discuss answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why might a researcher insist that they can/will not
implement the RRS for their research compendium?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What response might you give to that researcher to encourage
them to meet the conditions of the RRS?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What are some “strong and compelling rationales” for
applying legal encumbrances to sharing of a compendium?</strong></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>There are several possible reasons a researcher may insist
that they can/will not implement the RRS for their research compendium.
Here are some examples:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The researcher does not hold the copyright to their materials. For
example, the data used in their analysis may have been purchased from a
commercial data producer.</li>
<li>The researcher is a champion of Open Science and does not want to
encumber their materials with a license. They want anyone who wants to
access and reuse the materials can do so without any restrictions.</li>
<li>The researcher has plans to conduct follow-up studies using their
code and data. By allowing anyone to access the materials, the
researcher fears that their research will be scooped before they have a
chance to publish their findings.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Responses to the above examples may include the
following:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is possible that the data producer allows redistribution of at
least parts of the data used in the analysis. If not, other parts of the
compendium, such as the code used to generate the analysis dataset from
the original data can be licensed. Be sure to include detailed
information on how others can access the data from the original
producer.</li>
<li>Licenses do not have to be restrictive at all. In fact, licenses
give others explicit permission to use the materials without
restrictions if so desired. By assigning a permissive license to the
materials or placing the materials in the public domain under CC0, you
are supporting Open Science by signaling to others that the materials
are being offered for maximum reuse.</li>
<li>Providing access to your research compendium affords the community
the opportunity to examine the evidence underlying research findings,
which is critical to reproducibility. When you provide access, you can
also apply an attribution license, which makes it a requirement that
anyone who uses your compendium must give you credit as the
creator.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Two “strong and compelling rationale” for assigning a
restrictive license to data may be that:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The materials were used under an existing license that required
users to apply the same license restrictions as a condition for using
the materials (i.e., ShareAlike license).</li>
<li>The data contain personally identifiable or protected health
information that cannot be publicly released, and so licensing is not an
option. In this case, the researcher may require users to sign a data
use agreement that specifies requirements for mitigating disclosure
risks and adhering to laws and regulations governing the protection of
human subjects.</li>

<li>Placing scientific materials into the public domain to maximize the

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As you have learned so far in this curriculum, the data curation
process entails many steps that support the long-term sustainability and
reuse of your research data. In this episode, you will learn why storing
this compendium package in an appropriate location is a crucial step in
ensuring that other researchers can find your data and research outputs
and reuse them in the future. With a steadily increasing amount of data
repositories available to researchers, it can be difficult to know which
repository is right for your research data and will support keeping your
data safeguarded and preserved. Lin et al. (2020) define a set of
principles defining digital repositories that serve this function called
the TRUST principles:</p>
<p><strong>T</strong> - Transparency</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> - Responsibility</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> - User Focus</p>
<p><strong>S</strong> - Sustainability</p>
<p><strong>T</strong> - Technology</p>
<p>If a digital repository enacts these principles, you can reasonably
consider it to be a trustworthy repository for your data. A helpful
guiding framework for assessing if a digital repository exemplifies the
TRUST principles is the <a href="https://www.coretrustseal.org/" class="external-link">CoreTrustSeal certification</a>,
which offers a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3638211" class="external-link">catalogue of
requirements</a> that represent a trustworthy data repository for your
research data. This catalogue includes 16 data repository requirements
that are assessed in repositories and if the repository meets those
requirements, it gains the CoreTrustSeal certification. In the “Things
to Consider When Choosing a Repository” section below, the process of
assessing the trustworthiness of a repository based on the CoreTrustSeal
requirements are detailed.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Spotlight: Data Sharing Platforms - Are They Trustworthy Repositories?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>There are many platforms available to researchers for storing and
sharing their data, such as <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.cos.io/products/osf" class="external-link">Open Science Framework</a>, and
<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html" class="external-link">ArcGIS Online</a>. However,
can these platforms be considered trustworthy repositories? Information
scientists and librarians often do not place these kinds of data sharing
platforms in the same categories as other trustworthy repositories,
despite their heavy usage as research compendium storage products. Data
curators may need to discuss with researchers why a trustworthy
repository is a better choice for the long-term preservation of their
research compendium, based on the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>While these platforms may have high visibility in some research
areas (such as geospatial scientists sharing data in ArcGIS Online),
they often do not adhere to the CoreTrustSeal requirements and the TRUST
principles. This means that the data may not have the same assurances
for long-term preservation, governance, and transparency as a
trustworthy repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Trustworthy repositories have dedicated personnel to support data
depositors, which may not be the case with these kinds of data sharing
platforms. Therefore, researchers may find themselves having to navigate
data deposit issues without the advice and guidance of a data
curator.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While platforms such as GitHub, Open Science Framework, and ArcGIS
Online are useful project management and collaboration platforms for the
research process, researchers should strive to store their research
compendia in trusted repositories that fit the TRUST principles and
CoreTrustSeal requirements.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, you will learn more about the different types of repositories
available to researchers, and how to assess their trustworthiness. As
funding agencies and publishing outlets continue to push for more data
sharing in academic research, the amount of repositories available for
this data has also grown. Choosing a trustworthy repository is important
for safeguarding the long-term sustainability and reuse potential of the
data. Beyond the trustworthiness of a repository, there are categories
of repositories that may be more suitable for the particular type of
research data you are working with, and may support more exposure and
reuse of your shared data. The Digital Curation Centre offers further
resources and discussion on the benefits and considerations of each of
these kinds of repositories.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="disciplinary-and-subject-focused-repositories">Disciplinary and Subject-Focused Repositories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#disciplinary-and-subject-focused-repositories"></a>
</h3>
<p>Disciplinary and subject-focused repositories cater to data and
research outputs from specific areas of study and focus, such as
political science, mechanical engineering, Indigenous data, and social
sciences. Examples of disciplinary repositories include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" class="external-link">National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a>, which provides access to research
outputs concerning biomedical and genomic information</li>
<li>
<a href="https://religiondatabase.org/landing/" class="external-link">Database of
Religious History</a>, a repository containing quantitative and
qualitative data pertaining to religious cultural history</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data.html" class="external-link">Center for
International Earth Science Information Network</a>, which provides
access to data concerning human-environment interactions across the
world.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://mukurtu.org/" class="external-link">Mukurtu</a>, a platform which
empowers Indigenous communities to manage, narrate, and share their
digital heritage</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/" class="external-link">Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)</a>, which
maintains and provides access to an extensive archive of social science
data for research and instruction purposes</li>
</ol>
<p>Many disciplinary repositories can be found on <a href="https://www.re3data.org/" class="external-link">Re3data</a>, a registry of research data
repositories that allows users to search by the research data subject
(note that if a repository is included on re3data.org, it does not mean
it is automatically a trusted repository and must still be evaluated for
trustworthiness by the researchers).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="generalist-repositories">Generalist Repositories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#generalist-repositories"></a>
</h3>
<p>Generalist repositories store and provide access to a wide range of
research data types and do not restrict content types by discipline.
These repositories are particularly useful for researchers whose
discipline does not have a repository dedicated to their area of study.
Examples of curated generalist repositories include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://dataverse.org/" class="external-link">Dataverse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datadryad.org/stash" class="external-link">Dryad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a></li>
</ol>
<p>While many generalist repositories can be considered trustworthy
repositories, researchers should still plan to evaluate each potential
repository they are considering for their data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="institutional-repositories">Institutional Repositories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#institutional-repositories"></a>
</h3>
<p>These repositories are associated with a particular institution, such
as a university/college, research institute, or national laboratory.,
and are generally used to store and showcase the outputs of researchers
within that institution (Callicott et al. 2016). These types of
repositories generally accept research materials from all disciplines of
research present at an institution, and thus can be considered
generalist repositories as opposed to disciplinary repositories focusing
on a specific area of research. Some schools have a single repository
for all research products (such as Temple University’s TUScholarShare)
while others may have separate repositories for data and other scholarly
products (pre-prints, articles, Electronic Theses and Dissertations,
etc.). Examples of institutional repositories include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://kilthub.cmu.edu/" class="external-link">KiltHub</a>, the official
institutional repository for Carnegie Mellon University, managed through
the University Libraries</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/" class="external-link">Oxford University Research
Archive</a>, the institutional repository for researchers at the
University of Oxford</li>
<li>
<a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-digital-repository" class="external-link">Stanford
Digital Repository</a>, managing scholarly outputs from researchers at
Stanford University</li>
</ol>
<p>Most institutional repositories have a dedicated support staff and a
mission for preserving scholarly information, and often constitute a
trustworthy digital repository. However, as is the case with
disciplinary and generalist repositories, researchers should plan time
in their research workflow to evaluate their repository of choice for
trustworthiness.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now that you have learned about different categories of repositories,
what are some additional tips for choosing the right repository for your
data? Researchers can look for the CoreTrustSeal logo when visiting the
website of a potential repository they might use for storing and sharing
their compendium package.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/03-cts-repository.jpg" title="An example of the CoreTrustSeal on a digital repository" alt="An example of the CoreTrustSeal on a digital repository" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>However, your repository of interest may not have the official
CoreTrustSeal certification. This does not necessarily mean that the
repository cannot be considered trustworthy! You can still use the 16
requirements of the CoreTrustSeal certification to review your potential
repository for trustworthiness and adherence to the TRUST principles.
The CoreTrustSeal certification is an example of a standard used to
signal that a repository meets the requirements of the TRUST principles,
but due to the extensive certification process required, some
repositories may not (yet) have this certification. Therefore, reviewing
a repository that does not have the CoreTrustSeal certification for its
adherence to the TRUST principles is incredibly important.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge that not every repository is a good
fit for all data. Sometimes recommending a repository outside of your
own institution is a better service than accepting something that is not
a good fit. Take some time to explore a specific data set and
repositories that would be a good fit for it. This hypothetical exercise

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In Lesson 2: Episode 3, you learned about writing appropriate
documentation for your research compendium (such as README files) to aid
in its reuse, based on the characteristics of your data and code. When
we are working with data that we have collected ourselves and the data
has no ethical or legal restrictions that prevent us from sharing it,
using the guidelines listed in this curriculum to create the final
compendium package and its documentation can be relatively
straightforward. However, many researchers may find themselves in a
situation where their research materials pose additional considerations
for the sharing process, which may influence how they arrange and
prepare their research compendium for sharing. These situations may
include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Working with restricted data that has a high risk to harm an
individual, group, geographical location, entity, etc. if released
publicly.</li>
<li>Using data that is owned by a company/not created or owned by the
researcher</li>
<li>Attempting to share complex research outputs such as software which
may require additional documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>In this episode, we will discuss restricted materials, proprietary
materials, and complex computing outputs that may be included in
compendium packages, and you will learn what additional considerations
may need to be made when depositing these materials into a trustworthy
repository.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the context of this curriculum, we can consider restricted
materials to constitute data, software, and any other research ephemera
that meets the definition of “restricted.” The definition of
“restricted” may vary across organizations and contexts. For example,
the <a href="https://www.directives.doe.gov/terms_definitions/restricted-data" class="external-link">Atomic
Energy Act of 1954</a> defines restricted data as all information
pertaining to the design, manufacture, or use of atomic weapons, the
production of special nuclear material, the use of special <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/access-restricted-data" class="external-link uri">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/access-restricted-data</a>)
define restricted data as “data that cannot be released directly to the
public research community due to possible risk(s) to study participants
as well as the confidentiality promised to them.” Researchers should
take special consideration in understanding what constitutes restricted
data in their research context. What constitutes a restricted material
may be influenced by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your organizational affiliation and where your organization is
located</li>
<li>Who your collaborators (if any) are</li>
<li>Who is funding your research</li>
</ol></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="proprietary-materials">Proprietary Materials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#proprietary-materials"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Proprietary materials (such as data, software, etc.) are those which
may be used in the research process to achieve a certain result, but are
not owned by the researcher and thus generally cannot be shared openly
in a compendium package. This may include data that is purchased or
loaned from a company, software code developed by a private company, or
other research tools in which the researcher has to specially request
its use in their project.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="complex-computing">Complex Computing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#complex-computing"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Sharing a research compendium that contains complex computing
materials such as software built by the researcher requires additional
considerations for curating the package for reproducibility.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does the repository where you are storing the research compendium
have sufficient infrastructure for storing/providing access to your
software?</li>
<li>Does your documentation adequately explain how reusers can install
and use the software?</li>
<li>Does your documentation outline a clear plan about how reusers may
be made aware of any updates made to the software?</li>

<p>Some repositories may not have the technical capability to host data
and code where the access must be restricted and cannot be made publicly
available with no access limitations. As you use the knowledge you
learned from Lesson 4: Episode 3 to choose appropriate repositories,
consider if a repository can host your restricted materials, proprietary
materials, and complex computing products in a manner that balances
reuse with protection of their special considerations.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Discussion: Balancing Reproducibility with Proper Data Sharing Procedures</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>As you learned in Lesson 1 from the definitions of empirical,
statistical, and computational reproducibility, the factors needed to
achieve reproducibility varies depending on the research context. In
each of the scenarios below, consider how the researcher might balance
their goals in making their work reproducible while adhering to proper
procedures around restricted materials.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Restricted Data with National Security
Considerations</strong><br>
You work at a National Laboratory and are finishing up a research
project which was dual-funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
and a federal government agency. As a part of your NSF funding, you are
required to share your research data from the project, but the federal
agency which co-funded the project stipulates that the data has national
security considerations and cannot be shared publicly. What do you do?
Are there ways you can still share some of your research outputs to
encourage reproducibility while satisfying the requirements of both
organizations?</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Data Purchased from a Company</strong><br>
You have just received a grant from a funding agency to study the
television viewing habits of teenagers in your country, using a dataset
you purchased from a media company that tracks television viewing
patterns for various media networks. As of a year later, you have
successfully completed your project and you are getting ready to put
together your final research outputs and close out the grant project.
You see that your data has to be shared in order to satisfy the grant’s
requirements, but you are not sure if you can share the data that you
purchased from a company. What questions do you need to ask in this
situation? What are some solutions to this problem, or possible
compromises?</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Sharing Lab-Built Software</strong><br>
You are a graduate researcher in the McMurray Lab, where you have been
working on developing software that collects footage from eSports
tournaments and prepares machine learning training data from the
footage. The PI of the lab has asked you to develop the compendium
package to share the software and associated documentation to satisfy
mandates from the funder of the project. The software requires a very
specific computing environment to function, and you are concerned about
whether other people will be able to use the software properly after
downloading it from the repository. What should you consider as you
prepare the compendium package?</p>

</button>
<div id="collapseSolution1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionSolution1" aria-labelledby="headingSolution1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>While there are no discrete correct answers for each of these cases,
there are a few possible considerations to explore for each of these
scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Is it possible to share a metadata-only
description of your research data in a repository, and in the
accompanying documentation include information on how the full dataset
can be accessed from the federal agency? In this case, useful
information about the data has still been shared with potential reusers,
and they have been given guidance on the additional steps they need to
take to access the full dataset since it cannot be fully publicly
shared.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> In the same vein as Scenario 1, will the
company allow you to share a metadata-only description of the purchased
data in a repository, and in the accompanying documentation include
information on how the full dataset can be purchased directly from the
company? If this is not allowable, can the company offer any compromises
on how their intellectual property can be protected while also allowing
you to satisfy your data sharing requirements? Who might be possible
representatives of the company who can help answer these questions? The
company’s legal department may be helpful in exploring this.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Since the data requires extremely
specific computing environments to function, make sure your README is
incredibly detailed in describing what the reuser needs to do to create
this computing environment, and be sure to list the contact information
for who to contact from the research team in case the software
malfunctions or becomes obsolete. While the goals of data curation are
to reduce how often the original researchers need to be contacted by
data reusers, in cases with complex computing, it may be
unavoidable.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Exercise: Create a README for a Compendium Package with Special Cases of Data and Code</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In Lesson 2: Episode 3, you learned about the specific elements
needed in a README file. We will now ask you to apply this information
towards creating a README file for a research compendium containing
special cases of data and code. You will not be creating each section of
the README, but rather discussing what major key areas need to be
included in the document based on the below scenario.</p>
<p>Scenario: You and your lab have created software that can be used to
analyze biological data from lobster populations to identify the
geographic extent of overfished areas in the ocean. This software has
the potential for wide-reaching impacts on policies around the
commercial fishing industries and sustainability initiatives in coastal
areas. Therefore, you and the other researchers want to share this
software publicly to support its widespread reuse. However, you have
concerns about sharing the software as it requires an extremely specific
computing environment, and you are unsure if other researchers will be
able to duplicate this computing environment without the specialized
equipment used in your lab to run the software. At your weekly lab
meeting, you and the team discuss what needs to be included in the
README accompanying the software in order to support the reuse of the
software.</p>
<p>The following questions are examples of what to consider when
creating a README in this case of sharing complex computing
products:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How will you clearly define the specific computing environment
needed to run the software? Are there any specific</li>
<li>Will you include your contact information to allow researchers to
get in touch if they have trouble running the software?</li>
<li>Do you plan to do regular updates of the software to make sure all
dependencies and code continue to work? If so, how will you reflect this
information in the README to ensure that researchers know how to access
the latest version of the software?</li>

<p>Discuss how you and the team will design the README for this complex
computing product. What additional information will need to be included
in the README given the complexity of the software? While there are no
discrete correct answers for this challenge, your discussion may include
the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How the complex computing environment (operating system and version
number, other software dependencies needed, etc.) will be described in
the README</li>
<li>Any sections you will add/omit to the README to support the
effective reuse of the software</li>
