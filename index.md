This lesson is the final lesson of the Curating for Reproduciblity curriculum.  Previous lessons, ([Lesson 1: Introduction to Curating for Reproducibility](https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-01-intro/), [Lesson 2: Curating for Reproducibility Workflows](https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-02-workflows/), and [Lesson 3: Assessing Reproducibility](https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-03-assessing/)), defined the object of curating for reproducibilty as the *research compendium,** which undergoes a rigorous data quality review process that involves file, documentation, data, and code review.  This data quality review supports reproducibilty of published scientific findings.

Final curating for reproducibilty activities center on assembling and sharing the compendium to allow the scientific community and its stakeholders to access and resuse it.  The goal of this lesson is to give learners an understanding of the process of packaging and publishing research compendium materials, and the issues that require careful consideration during this process.
