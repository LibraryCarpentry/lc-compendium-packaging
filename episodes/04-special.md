teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What are some special cases to consider when publishing data and compendium packages?"
- "What are examples of restricted and proprietary materials in compendium packages?"
- "What are examples of complex computing research outputs that may be included in compendium packages?"
- "How can researchers balance reproducibility goals with proper handling of restricted and proprietary materials in compendium packages?"
objectives:
- "Identify examples of restricted and proprietary materials that may be present in compendium packages"
- "Learn how to balance reproducibility goals with special cases of data restrictions/usage"
- "Create proper documentation for restricted and proprietary materials in compendium packages"
keypoints:
- "When putting together compendium packages, researchers should be aware of any restricted, proprietary, or complex computing materials they are working with."
- "Restricted materials cannot be fully released to the public due to the high risk they can pose."
- "Proprietary materials are those which are not owned by the researcher, and generally cannot be shared publicly."
- "Complex computing materials such as software may require additional considerations when included in compendium packages, such as documentation outlining its development and use."
- "When working with any of these special cases, researchers should allow for extra time in their process of compiling their compendium packages to ensure they are balancing reproducibility goals with proper precautions."
